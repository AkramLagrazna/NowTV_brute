Brute Force for NowTV codes.
I just made up this script in 10 mins to randomly try a six-digit alphanumerical code on the form 
At first i was expecting a 404 if the code is invalid, 
but the server response is 200 OK . So i had to use the PyQuery module to parse the HTML and output it to the user
this is my quickest way to do this , not the best.







ps for NowTV, upgrade your security. At least put in a captcha.
