Brute Force for NowTV codes.  \n 


I just made up this script in 10 mins to randomly try a six-digit alphanumerical code on the form 
At first i was expecting a 404 if the code is invalid, 
but the server response is 200 OK .
So i had to use the PyQuery module to parse the HTML and output it to the user
this is my quickest way to do this , not the best.
Update: 
I made this script more "User-Friendly", a friend of mine asked me so. 
by the way this is still working well. 
This surprises me. 



ps for NowTV, **upgrade your security. At least put in a captcha.** 


**script made for education purposes**
